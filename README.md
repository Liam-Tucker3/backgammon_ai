# This project involves developing a Backgammon AI for an Artificial Intelligence class.
This project was built from a template provided by https://github.com/aknandi/backgammon . I include all files from this project, including those from the template repository and written reports of my work process, in this repository.

# backgammon
Python modules to play backgammon (human or computer)

## System Requirements

- Python 3 (you may need to change the commands below to `python3 ...` if that is how you run python 3 on your machine)

## How to run the game

* **Human vs Computer**: run `python single_player.py`, then choose the computer strategy to play against
* **Human vs Human**: run `python two_player.py`
* **Computer vs Computer**: run `python main.py` The two 'players' can have different strategies. 
This runs many games with a different 'player' starting each time and returns the probability of the strategies being equally good.
